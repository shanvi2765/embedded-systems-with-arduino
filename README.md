# Embedded Systems with Arduino

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of peripheral interfacing exercises completed as part of my learning journey in embedded systems with Arduino. These are categorized into key areas of embedded systems development, demonstrating fundamental concepts of interfacing Arduino with various electronic components and sensors.

For detailed information, code, and simulation recordings for each interfacing, please navigate to its respective folder.

## Tools Used
* **Arduino IDE:** For writing, compiling, and uploading Arduino sketches.
* **Tinkercad Circuits:** For simulating Arduino circuits and testing code virtually.

## Libraries Used
This repository primarily utilizes standard Arduino libraries including:
* `Wire.h` (for I2C communication)
* `LiquidCrystal.h` (for LCD displays)
* `Servo.h` (for servo motor control)
